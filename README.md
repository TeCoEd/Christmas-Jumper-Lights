# Christmas Jumper Lights
# Tweet @PiTests ON to trigger the "XMAS Jumper" to light up in full festive glory.

This hack makes use of:
- an old Christmas Jumper, 
- the Raspberry Zero, 
- some cheap LEDs 
- a bit of Python 

The combination brings you an Interactive Social Media Crimbo Jumper.  Tweet "@PiTests ON" and the code kicks in.  It triggers the lights on the jumper to turn on and the ligth show begins.  So now all Twitter users can bring a little bit of Christmas cheer and engage the lights on the Jumper.  To thank you for your efforts the "Light Bot" will send you a confirmation message via your tweeter feed. You will receive a notification that you turned on the Christmas Light Jumper including the time of your interaction.  

Happy Christmas
